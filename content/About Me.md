# About Me

I'm a software engineer focused on building AI/ML applications. I am about to graduate from Columbia University with a Master's in Computer Science and a concentration in Machine Learning. I love to build, learn, and play with new technologies, and I hope that is one thing that comes across in this site. 

I am currently based out of New York City.
