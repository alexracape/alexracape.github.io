**Penne** is the first Python client library implementing the **NOODLES messaging protocol**, enabling multiple client applications to interact collaboratively with data in real-time. The library provides a foundation for building distributed, interactive data visualization and manipulation systems.

## Technical Overview

**Protocol Implementation**:
- WebSocket-based communication
- CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) message encoding
- Scene graph architecture for managing shared state

**Architecture**:
- Fully customizable component system through subclassing
- Clean separation between application logic and protocol handling
- Modular design for easy integration with existing Python applications

**Key Features**:
- Real-time collaborative data interaction
- Efficient binary message encoding
- Extensible scene graph components
- Simple, Pythonic API

The library abstracts away the complexity of the NOODLES protocol, allowing developers to focus on building collaborative applications without worrying about low-level messaging details.
